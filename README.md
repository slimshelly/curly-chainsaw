# curly-chainsaw
- a vue framework test project: an attempt to clone https://concreteislands.cargo.site/, built with vue components.
- in the future, I hope to adapt this repo into a website to document my woodworking projects.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn serve
```
- you can go to port :8080 to see live updates!
